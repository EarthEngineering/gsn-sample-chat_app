# GSN Chat ChatApp

(Gas Stations Network) Chat ChatApp

Unlike traditional Ethereum powered smart contract applications, when using Meta Transactions users are not required to have ETH or even have an Ethereum wallet to interact with smart contracts.

**Fund your App on the RelayHub**

Now you need to fund you dApp:
